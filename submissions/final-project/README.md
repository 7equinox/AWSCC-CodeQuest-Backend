# Final Project Execution Guide

## Preparations

1. **Locate the Project**: Open your terminal or command prompt. Type `cd /path/to/your/project` and press enter. Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path where the project file is stored.

2. **Activate the Environment**: If you're using Unix or MacOS, type `source final_project_env/bin/activate` and press enter. For Windows users, type `.\final_project_env\Scripts\activate` and press enter.

3. **Run the Code**: Now, you're ready to run the application. Type `python app.py` and press enter.

Ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed in your virtual environment. If not, type `pip install -r requirements.txt` and press enter to install them.

## Important

This guide assumes that Python and the required packages are already installed on your machine. If they're not, please install them before proceeding.
